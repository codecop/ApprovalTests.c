# Open

* test resolving a linux tool, should work in ubuntu-latest
* #ifndef __approval_assert_equals add a plain assert reporter by default
* all malloc can fail - what to do? - return NULL; /* error */
* get first working reporter of list
* use bool instead of 0/1/int
* use NULL instead of 0 everywhere

* Documentation

  * describe features related to usual approvals:
  * verify text, verify xml, quiet reporter, all diff reporters, cmocka integration
  * binaries for linux and windows x64

* create second Example with reporters

## Ideas

* use x86 ubuntu server to test it
* build all o and exe files into Default?
