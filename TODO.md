* TODO in code, unused
* TODO test resolving a linux tool, should work in ubuntu-latest
* idea: Create Windows, Mac and Linux Strict containing the diff tools as entries.
* #ifndef __approval_assert_equals add a plain assert reporter by default
* check coverage - few places missing
* all malloc can fail - what to do?

* Windows SDK 7.1 - see command line and add to Diff Tools
  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\x64\WinDiff.Exe"

* Documentation

  * describe features related to usual approvals:
