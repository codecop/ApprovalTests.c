# Open

* TODO in code, unused
* TODO test resolving a linux tool, should work in ubuntu-latest
* #ifndef __approval_assert_equals add a plain assert reporter by default
* check coverage - few places missing
* all malloc can fail - what to do?
* get first working reporter of list

* Documentation

  * describe features related to usual approvals:
  * verify text, verify xml, quiet reporter, all diff reporters, cmocka integration
  * binaries for linux and windows x64

* create second Example with reporters

## Ideas

* use x86 ubuntu server to test it
* build all o and exe files into Default?
* add more switches from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html
